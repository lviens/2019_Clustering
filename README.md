# Two-step clustering method to improve offshore-onshore deconvolution functions from the ambient seismic field


* We developped a method to improve the retrieval of clear deconvolution functions calculated from the ambient seismic field using unsupervised learning.

This repository contains data and python codes to reproduce some of the Figures of Viens and Iwata (2020, Accepted in JGR):
* The **Codes** folder contains:
  - **Reproduce_Fig_1_2.py** to reproduce Figures 1 and 2 of the paper
  - **Reproduce_Fig_4_5.py** to reproduce Figures 4 and 5 of the paper (data download required, see below)
  - **Function_clustering_DFs.py**, the main function to perform the clustering (used by the two codes above).

* The **Data** folder is empty, but the data to reproduce Figures 4 and 5 can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wbM-cN4gQ-MRhLOQaiXcHiXZ5Z5OOEsI/view?usp=sharing) and need to be copied in the **Data** folder.

* The **Figures** folder contains the four figures generated by the two codes.

**Additional info**:
  - The deconvolution functions in the paper are computed using the deconvolution_stab function available [here](https://github.com/lviens/2017_GJI/blob/master/Codes/Functions_GJI_2017.py).

  - The raw Hi-net and DONET 1 data can be downloaded [here](http://www.hinet.bosai.go.jp).
