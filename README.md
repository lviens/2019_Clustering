## Description:
We developped a method based on unsupervised learning to improve the retrieval of deconvolution functions between offshore and onshore stations. 

* This repo contains three folders:
  * **Codes** folder:
    - **Reproduce_Fig_1_2.py** to reproduce Figures 1 and 2 of the paper
    - **Reproduce_Fig_4_5.py** to reproduce Figures 4 and 5 of the paper (data download required, see below)
    - **Function_clustering_DFs.py**, the main function to perform the clustering (used by the two codes above).

  * **Data** folder:
    - Empty, but the data required to reproduce Figures 4 and 5 can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wbM-cN4gQ-MRhLOQaiXcHiXZ5Z5OOEsI/view?usp=sharing) and need to be copied in the **Data** folder.

  * **Figures** folder:
    - Contains the 4 figures generated by the two codes.

## **Additional info**:
  * The deconvolution functions in the paper are computed using the deconvolution_stab function available [here](https://github.com/lviens/2017_GJI/blob/master/Codes/Functions_GJI_2017.py).

  * The raw Hi-net and DONET 1 data can be downloaded [here](http://www.hinet.bosai.go.jp).
