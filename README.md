# Two-step clustering method to improve offshore-onshore deconvolution functions from the ambient seismic field

* We developped a method to improve the retrieval of clear deconvolution functions calculated from the ambient seismic field using unsupervised learning. Details about the method can be found in Viens and Iwata (Submitted to JGR). EarthArXiv pre-print available soon.

* This repository contains:
  - The **Reproduce_Fig_1_2.py** code to reproduce Figures 1 and 2 of the paper
  - The **Reproduce_Fig_4_5.py** code to reproduce Figures 4 and 5 of the paper (data download required, see below)
  - The **Function_clustering_DFs.py** function, which include the main code to perform the clustering.
  
* The data to reproduce Figures 4 and 5 can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11vyxdjI4MEcMKhcSrieSBI4Llf8IHyJN/view?usp=sharing) and need to be copied in the **Data folder**.
