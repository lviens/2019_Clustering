# Two-step clustering method to improve offshore-onshore deconvolution functions from the ambient seismic field

* We developped a method to improve the retrieval of clear deconvolution functions calculated from the ambient seismic field using unsupervised learning. Details about the method can be found in Viens and Iwata (Submitted to JGR). EarthArXiv pre-print available soon.

* This repository contains:
  - **Reproduce_Fig_1_2.py** to reproduce Figures 1 and 2 of the paper
  - **Reproduce_Fig_4_5.py** to reproduce Figures 4 and 5 of the paper (data download required, see below)
  - **Function_clustering_DFs.py**, the main function to perform the clustering (used by the two codes above).
  
* The data to reproduce Figures 4 and 5 can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11vyxdjI4MEcMKhcSrieSBI4Llf8IHyJN/view?usp=sharing) and need to be copied in the **Data** folder.
