## Description:
We developed a method based on unsupervised learning to improve the retrieval of deconvolution functions between offshore and onshore stations. We applied our method to retrieve deconvolution functions between offshore seismic stations deployed on top of the Nankai, Japan, and surrounding onshore stations. 

* This repo contains three folders:
  * **Codes** folder:
    - **Reproduce_Fig_1_2.py** to reproduce Figures 1 and 2 of the paper.
    - **Reproduce_Fig_4_5.py** to reproduce Figures 4 and 5 of the paper (data download required, see below).
    - **Function_clustering_DFs.py**, the main function to perform the clustering (used by the two codes above).

  * **Data** folder:
    - Empty folder. The data required to reproduce Figures 4 and 5 can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wbM-cN4gQ-MRhLOQaiXcHiXZ5Z5OOEsI/view?usp=sharing) and should be placed in the **Data** folder.

  * **Figures** folder:
    - Contains the 4 figures generated by the two codes.

## Example:
The **Reproduce_Fig_4_5.py** code produces two figures. The first figure (Figure 4) is a plot of all the Z-Z deconvolution function between the station pair (e.g., KME18 and ARIH stations).

## **Additional info**:
  * We follow the method proposed by [Viens et al. (2017, GJI)](https://academic.oup.com/gji/article/210/1/210/3747441) to compute the deconvolution functions. The python function (e.g., deconvolution_stab) can be found [here](https://github.com/lviens/2017_GJI/blob/master/Codes/Functions_GJI_2017.py).

  * The raw Hi-net and DONET 1 data can be downloaded from the [Hi-net website](http://www.hinet.bosai.go.jp).
